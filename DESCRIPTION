Description: Implements conditional false-discovery rate hypothesis testing, used to perform high-dimensional hypothesis tests. Requires a set of summary statistics in an experiment of interest, and 'levers' on a second set of summary statistics at the same variables for a second experiment. Enables frequentist hypothesis testing with overall strong control of false-discovery rate. Can use several estimators of the cFDR function cFDR(p,q)=Pr(P<p,Q<q|H0).
